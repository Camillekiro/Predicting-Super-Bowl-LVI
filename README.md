# Predicting-Super-Bowl-LVI (Machine Learning)


In this project, I predicted the final scores of both superbowl LVI teams before kick off.
The data for this analysis was provided by advanced sports analytics and I used R for the analysis.
A full report with summary statistics and some visualization will be provided shortly as a PDF.
Thank you for your time and attention.

Stay Tuned!
