# Predicting-Super-Bowl-LVI


In this project, I predicted the final scores of both superbowl LVI teams before kick off.
The data for this analysis was provided by advanced sports analytics and I used R for the analysis.
A full report with summary statistics and some visualization will be provided shortly as a PDF.
Taking you for your time and attention, you are welcomed to leave some thoughts.

Stay Tuned!
